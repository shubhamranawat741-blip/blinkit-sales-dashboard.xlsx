# BlinkIt Grocery Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes BlinkIt grocery sales data to uncover trends and key performance indicators (KPIs) impacting sales across different outlets, item types, and product attributes. The analysis leverages pre-cleaned, publicly available data to create dashboards, perform KPI evaluation, and extract actionable insights for business decision-making.

---

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from a public GitHub repository containing BlinkIt grocery sales data. The data was already cleaned and structured, allowing the focus to be on exploratory analysis, KPI evaluation, and visualization rather than data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Total Sales by Item Type**  
   - Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.  
   - Additional KPI Metrics: Asses how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with item type.  
     

3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales**  
   - Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.  
   - Additional KPI Metrics: Asses how other KPIs vary with fat content by outlet.  
  

4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment**  
   - Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.  
    

5. **Sales by Outlet Size**  
   - Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.  
   

6. **Sales by Outlet Location**  
   - Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.

## Problem Statement
Retail grocery sales data is fragmented across multiple outlets with differing characteristics (location, size, fat content). The challenge is to consolidate this data to identify which factors most strongly influence sales, customer ratings, and product popularity. Understanding these drivers enables targeted improvement in marketing and inventory decisions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project tracks the following KPIs to measure business health:
- Total Sales
- Average Sales
- Number of Items Sold
- Average Customer Rating
- Sales by Outlet Size
- Sales by Outlet Type

---

## Objective
- Analyze precise sales patterns and customer feedback using the pre-cleaned BlinkIt grocery sales dataset.
- Develop interactive dashboards and visualizations to interpret these KPIs effectively.
- Conduct statistical examination including correlation and outlier detection to provide deeper insights.
- Deliver findings that aid in strategic retail and inventory decisions.

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms fat content, outlet size, and outlet location as significant determinants of sales. Product category trends highlight the importance of focusing on fruits and vegetables, while larger and Tier 3 outlets present the most lucrative targets for growth. Through detailed KPIs and visualization tools, the project offers stakeholders valuable insights for optimizing retail strategy.
